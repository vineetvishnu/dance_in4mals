                    <p>Hi, I'm Suparna Roy Gupta, the dance coordinator of IN4MALS society. I began my dance career at DR. RUMPA SINHA'S NATYALAYA from the age of 2yr. I am doing a junior diploma course in Bharatnatyam also from Prayag Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya.
                        I have competed in many national level and state level competitions. I am skilled in contemporary, semi-classical and bollywood dance. Recently I'm co-ordinating the dance group of IN4MALS. I try to guide & motivate all the members
                        in our dance society. What I think about Dance is ,it is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways, and is a fantastic way to escape the stresses and cares of everyday life. When I
                        dance I am completely get released from the preoccupations and stresses of day to day life. I enjoy growth, and performing is a wonderful catalyst in which this can happen.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Adyasha Mohanty. I am a professionally trained dancer and started my journey in dancing at the age of 5 years. Ever Since I watched bollywood actors dancing in movies, I wanted to do that. All thanks to my parents who supported
                        me and started giving me professional training since I was 4 years old. It's been more than 12-13 years since I am performing. I am professionally trained in Odissi but also perform in bollywood, semiclassical forms as well. I
                        have competed in many national and international level programs as well. I'm here in IN4MALS members of our dance team since 1-2 months & already took part in 2 projects. IN4MALS society has already given me the chance to be a
                        part of two projects which were done online because of the pandemic. I expect, as soon as things get normal, we'd meet offline, we will start performing on stage and my skills will be even more enhanced.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Oshmita Sarkar. I'm a second year student of CSE. I have a specialization in bharatanatyam, folk, fusion and regional dances. I have participated in various competitions of the IIT's and have made it to the finals. I also took
                        part in the KORUS fest of KIIT and have been a part of various local projects of In4mals for its social media page and YouTube channel. For me, dance is like a spiritual purification. Every move, every beat creates an aura of positivity
                        within me. I have been a passionate dancer since childhood and still continue the learning process as I believe that learning must never stop. In4mals has provided me with a platform to showcase my individuality as well as the
                        tallents that I have achieved from continuous practices. I can firmly affirm that being a part of this society has helped me grow as a dancer and unleashed a new being within me.
